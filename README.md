# 1. Matlab Code 
TBA

# 2. Simulation Data
20 simulations runs were conducted for 8 different concept drift models (CDM). Details of the simulation models can be found in the article. Each CDM is stored as a struct with "X" and "Y" arrays. For a total of 700 observations, 19 predictors and their 2 lagged measurements are included in X (there are 19x3 = 57 predictors/columns in total in X) and the response variables (concentration of product B) is in Y.
